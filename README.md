# Porteus skype
Porteus v3.2.2 64bit module skype v8.11.0.4
Github does not allow large files so I had to break it up.
joinskype.sh will merge the parts into a xzm module and attempt to
change permissions and ownership.
Copy or move skypeforlinux-64-v8.11.0.4.xzm to your modules folder.
As root change permissions to be NOT executable and change owner to guest.
